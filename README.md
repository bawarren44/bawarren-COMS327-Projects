# COMS327

This class focused on the fundamentals of C and C++. 

* The file fib-2.c function calls to print out the first 49 instances of the Fibonacci sequence.
* The file pascal.c uses memory allocation practices to contruct a pascal triangle with the number inputted by the user: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56376957/118156093-95119080-b3de-11eb-9028-3de4b9183464.png)

* The file count.c uses structs to contruct a linked list with a single string and unsigned integer. This file counts the number of times a word appears within a file.

* The file mark.c uses structs as nodes of a linked list to take in a valid input file like so: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56376957/118157705-84fab080-b3e0-11eb-9946-5b0f1ec80796.png) 
with this input file we output the Reachable and Unreachable nodes.

* The file instack.cpp is the implementation of a stack using a linked list. Tested like so: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56376957/118158007-dc008580-b3e0-11eb-9732-47d897ac183f.png)

* The file myexpr.cpp is used to understand class hierarchy of expressions: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56376957/118168864-ed03c380-b3ed-11eb-9f87-3713846ef494.png)

* The folder contains the files needed the project of this class, containing 4 parts. Each part adding functionality to the existing checkers game.
